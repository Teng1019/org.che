The halogen is mo electronegative than carbon, and the C-X vond is polarized with a partial positice charge pn carbon and a partial -ve charge on the halogen 
e-ity: I< Br< Cl < F
Bond length: C-I > C-Br > C-Cl > C-F
Dipole moment: C-I < C-Br < C-Cl< C-F
The London force (temporary dipoles) is the strongest intermolecular attraction in alkyl halides.
• Molecules with larger surface areas have larger London attractions, resulting in higher boiling points.
• The relative surface areas of halogen atoms is proportional to their van der Waals radii

The other halogens are larger than fluorine, giving them more surface area and raising the boiling points of their alkyl halides.

Most nucleophiles are basic, so the same species might react both as Nu- (giving substitution) and B- (giving elimination). Therefore, substitution and elimination reactions often compete
